		<h2>About this Exibition Space</h3>
		<p>
		  This virtual exibition space that you are about to enter tells the stories of three artists—Martha Ann Honeywell, Sarah Rogers, and Saunders Ken Grems Nellis—who worked at the intersection of visual art, performance, and disability in the early to mid-nineteenth century. Born with significant physical disabilities, these artists traveled throughout North and South America, the Caribbean, and Europe creating and selling silhouettes and performing their unexpected capacities and incapacities for customers. Although rarely remembered today, these artists’ lives and works testify to the power of disability as a source of creative inspiration and profit. Capitalizing on the prejudices and curiosities of their patrons, Honeywell, Rogers, and Nellis made art, traveled the world, and sustained distinguished careers.

				<h3>Art description</h3>
		
				<p id="artBackgroundHoneywell">
				In 1848, Lydia Ann Battin and Jackson Hughes of West Chester,
				Pennsylvania celebrated their marriage by commissioning a unique pair of
				cut-and-paste silhouettes. The bust-length profiles—cut skillfully from
				black paper, pasted onto white paper, and arranged so that they gazed at
				one another—were not particularly unusual, apart from the superb
				craftsmanship they displayed. Instead, the profiles’ uniqueness lay in
				the inscriptions penned below the images: “Cut Without Hands by M. A.
				Honeywell.”

				<h3>About the artist</h3>
		
				<p id="aboutHoneywell">
				Honeywell was an extraordinary American artist. For nearly sixty years
				(1798-1856), she traveled, primarily by herself, across the expanding
				United States and in more than five countries around the world (Canada,
				France, Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom), enthralling
				patrons with her seemingly surprising confluence of artistic ability and
				physical disability. Customers like the Hugheses attended Honeywell’s
				shows as much to examine and acquire her visual art as to gaze at her
				atypical body. Capitalizing on this unexpected combination of artistic
				capacity and physical incapacity, Honeywell sustained a successful and
				profitable career.

				<h3>Interesting fact</h3>
		
				<p id="factHoneywell">
				Honeywell’s career began early. Born in Westchester, New York in 1786,
				her parents moved shortly after to New York City, where they opened a
				fruit store on Harman Street. The family soon learned that Martha Ann’s
				body attracted customers as much as the apples and pears they sold.
				“Hundreds, particularly of young people,” one patron recalled, went to
				the store “under the pretense of purchasing fruit but in reality for the
				purpose of seeing this marvellous child.” From this experience,
				Honeywell’s parents decided that exhibition could be a way for Martha
				Ann to earn her living. They arranged for her first show at the nearby
				American Museum at the young age of twelve.

				<h3>Art description</h3>
				<p id="artBackgroundNellis">
				  Like Honeywell and Rogers, Nellis centered his exhibitions on the
				  duality of artistic ability and physical difference. He usually began
				  his shows with demonstrations of his skills in the visual arts, creating
				  watch-papers, valentines, paper fly-boxes, and silhouettes, all with his
				  feet. Then the artist captivated customers with performances of
				  dexterous tasks. He wound a watch, shot a bow and arrow, loaded and
				  fired a pistol, and even shaved a member of the audience. Nellis’s
				  exhibitions closed with music and dance. He played the violin,
				  accordion, cello, triangle, and drums; sang; and danced. Audience
				  members described their visits as “astonishing” and “entertaining.”

				<h3>About the artist</h3>
		  
				<p id="aboutNellis">
				  While Honeywell was performing at the Peale Museum in Baltimore,
				  Saunders Ken Grems Nellis, then only eleven years old, was exhibiting
				  his body, which lacked arms and hands, and his artistic skills across
				  town at the Maryland Museum, launched the previous year by James
				  Griffiths. Patrons described Nellis’s shows—which combined visual art,
				  music, dance, theater, and comedy—as evidence of “extraordinary genius.”
				  Over the next four decades, the artist performed in hundreds of venues
				  for thousands of patrons across North and South America, the Caribbean,
				  and Europe.

				  alt="Animation of silhoette of Nellis drawing with his foot"
				  class="web-img"
				/>
		  
				<h3>Interesting fact</h3>
		  
				<p id="factNellis">
				  As Nellis performed more in museums, the carnivalesque nature of his
				  shows increased. Some museum managers paired his exhibitions with those
				  of African, Native, and Hispanic peoples whose racialized features they
				  displayed as the primary attraction. Catering to white customers’
				  prejudices and penchant for spectacle, museum operators exhibited men
				  and women of color as freakish and subhuman. Again, performances of
				  disability mirrored those of race. Museumgoers marveled at Nellis’s body
				  just as they did the racially othered men and women on view.

				<h3>Art description</h3>
				<p id="artBackgroundRogers">
				  Audience members were not the only admirers of Rogers’s artwork and she
				  soon attracted the attention of other artists. Charles Willson Peale,
				  one of the foremost painters, naturalists, and museum proprietors of the
				  day, learned of her shows and acquired their productions for the
				  collection of his Philadelphia Museum. Rogers donated a “drawing of
				  Flowers” (two Burdock flowers with insects nearby). Like other viewers,
				  Peale valued Rogers for their confluence of artistic skill and physical
				  difference, which appealed to his dual interests in art and the natural
				  world.

				<h3>About the artist</h3>
		  
				<p id="aboutRogers">
				  Rogers was nearly Honeywell’s age—born just three years later, in 1789,
				  in Lempster, New Hampshire. Although she began making art at a young
				  age, her first public recognition came in 1806 when her work caught the
				  attention of a local newspaper editor. Describing her “striking”
				  artistic productions and body, which was “divested of all use of all of
				  her limbs,” the editor encouraged readers to call on Rogers to see her
				  faculties and issue monetary donations. This suggestion must have proved
				  satisfactory—and financially advantageous—to the artist. Within months
				  she began performing at the Columbian Museum in Boston and launched a
				  national tour.

				/>
		  
				<h3>Interesting fact</h3>
		  
				<p id="factRogers">
				  Rogers’s exhibitions, like Honeywell’s, centered on the juxtaposition of
				  ability and disability. Her advertisements described how “Nature” had
				  “deprived” her of limbs but, as if to make “amends,” bestowed on her
				  artistic talents that “surpassed all human belief.” Patrons tended to
				  agree. They called her shows “interesting and curious” and her art
				  deserving of “wonder and approbation.” Honeywell and Rogers’s combined
				  exhibition in Charleston proved especially popular. Customers convinced
				  them to extend their stay in the city and the artists arranged joint
				  shows in Savannah, Georgia and Norfolk, Virginia based on this success.
